unfortunately there is a dearth of good documentation/tutorials on Qt script.

Here's what i gather so far:

Create a QScriptEngine
Pass the script (as a string) to the function engine.evaluate()

So the script can be read from an external file into a string and that string used as the argument to evaluate().

QtScript has a limited selection of data types, so i will need to convert Genova's BitArray into something else, then pass that into the function.
how?

Make a QList<int> with first value the size of the bit array, second value the size of the chromosome (fixed), and the rest the bit array.
Pass this into the Qt Script.
A QList<int> is converted into a Qt script array using QScriptEngine::NewArray() whose elements are created using the QScriptValue(QScriptEngine *, int) constructor for each element of the list.

UPDATE
Success! See the code for how it is done. 

The script function name MUST be constant ("fitness"). It takes a array whose first element (arguments[0]) is the length of the Genome's BitArray of genes and whose remaining elements are the contents of that BitArray.
In future versions, with a user-defined fixed variable length, that should be an argument too (the second one).
Here is how to iterate:
for(var i=1; i<arguments[0]+1; i++)
